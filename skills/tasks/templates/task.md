<!-- Written by /specd:tasks to <spec_root>/<feature>/tasks/T<n>.md for a task whose body

## Goal

<!-- One paragraph: what exists when this task is done, and the design headings or
     decisions it follows. -->

## Files

<!-- One path per line, with "new" or "edit". -->

## Done-when

<!-- A command that exits 0, or an observable; the exact command when there is one. -->

## Commit

`{{type}}({{scope}}): {{summary}}`

## Tests

<!-- TDD only. One case per behaviour: name — what it asserts. Error paths get their own. -->

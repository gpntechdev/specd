<!-- specd:draft -->
<!-- Written by /specd:tasks to <spec_root>/<feature>/tasks.md; read by implement, review,
     verify and deliver. Ids T1.. never change after G3; review appends a
     "Review fixes (round n)" phase with new ids. A task is the block below. A heavy task
     (body past ~100 lines) keeps only the index line
     `- T<n> · <goal> · risk <low|high> · covers <ACs> · tasks/T<n>.md` here and its body
     lives in tasks/T<n>.md; light tasks stay inline next to it, and the file's own length
     does not matter. Fields per task: goal, files, done-when (a command or an
     observable), depends-on, risk (low|high), commit (Conventional Commit message implement
     uses verbatim), covers (AC ids), tests (TDD only: case names). The matrix has one row per
     AC; verify fills Evidence. state.yml mirrors the ids. Remove the first line on G3. -->

name: config
description: >
  Invoke whenever the user asks to change, set, show or check a specd setting (gate
  granularity, TDD, retention, PR host, ticket key, model roles, project commands) or runs
  `/specd:config [key=value ...]`. It reads `specd.yml`, shows the current value of the keys
  named (or the whole file when none), asks for the new values, patches them in place with
  `config-set` and shows `old -> new`. Not for creating the workspace; that is `/specd:init`.

# Skill: config

Changes settings in `specd.yml` after `init`, one or more keys per run. The only writer is
the `config-set` script, so comments, order and unknown keys survive and values land in their
documented form.

## Inputs

- `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resolve-paths"` output: the config path.
- [`../_shared/specd-yml.md`](../_shared/specd-yml.md): every key, its values and who reads it.
- The arguments, if any: `key=value` pairs or bare key names.

## Outputs

- The patched `<workspace_root>/specd.yml`.
- No commit; the change rides with the next step's commit, or the user commits it.

## Protocol

1. **Resolve.** Run `resolve-paths`. No config: say `run /specd:init first` and stop.
2. **Show.** With bare key names or no arguments, print the current line for each key named
   (all keys when none), taken from the file as it is. Unknown key: name the closest keys
   from `specd-yml.md` and stop.
3. **Ask.** For each key without a value, ask for one, listing the documented values from the
   `Key semantics` table. Refuse a value outside that list before touching the file.
   `sources` and `skills.allowlist` are lists: say they are edited by hand until their
   milestones and stop.
4. **Patch.** Run `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/config-set" --file <config>` with every
   `key=value` in one call. Show its `old -> new` list verbatim. On refusal, show the
   script's message and stop; never repair the file by hand.
5. **Say when it applies.** `flow.gate_granularity`, `flow.critic`, `flow.tdd` and
   `models.*` take effect at the next step that reads them; a step already running keeps
   its values. `git.*` and `commands.*` apply immediately.
6. **Handoff** per [`../_shared/handoff.md`](../_shared/handoff.md): `Produced` is the config
   path, `Next` is whatever the user was doing.

## Anti-patterns

- Editing `specd.yml` with a text tool; `config-set` is the only writer.
- Regenerating the file from the reference; unknown keys and comments would be lost.
- Changing a key the user did not name because it "looked wrong".
- Persuading the user to change a model role; roles are theirs to set.
